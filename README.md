<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
The project is to build a **Tic Tac Toe** game using html, css and javascript. *A game that takes seconds to learn but minutes to master!* No sure what **Tic Tac Toe** is? **Tic-tac-toe** (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

<h2>Our Goals</h2>
* Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
* Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
* Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
* Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
* Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
* Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world

<h2>Technical Requirements required to build the game</h2>
* Render a game board in the browser
* Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
* Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"cat’s game" if neither wins
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

<h2>How I built this game</h2>
First of all I wrote down step by step list of tasks how to approach building this game. Than I created html, css and javascript files, link them together and opened html in browser for futher testing.
